* run the file model_no_adjustment.jl to calculate the model without the adjustment market and print out the corresponding figure
* run the file variancecheck.jl to calculate and print out the basic statistical values
* run the file scenario generation.jl to generate scenarios for the model
* if you want to reproduce the results from the paper use the scenarios ./data/Example_Data_Sets/outputfile_used.csv
